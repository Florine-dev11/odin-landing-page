 
Teat stays full of milk, not air
Our unique Air Free vent is designed to help your baby swallow less air as they drink. It keeps the teat full of milk, not air, even when the bottle is horizontal.
Shaped for a secure latch
The shape and ribbed texture of the teat makes it easy for your baby to securely latch on and have an uninterrupted feed.

 
Easy to clean
Fewer parts and a wide neck mean you'll spend less time cleaning and enjoy more precious moments with your baby.
 
Simple to use
When you're ready for the next feed, just make sure the single-piece Air Free vent is on top when you assemble the baby bottle. No tinkering necessary.
